1- Storyworks IDEA
Our Storyworks concept is an AI-powered organizational tool designed for IBD team who deal with overwhelming amount of media content (photos, videos, interviews, workshop materials). Instead of manually renaming files that their client gave them, sorting all folders, and building reference spreadsheets, LABEL (the name of our solution) automates these repetitive tasks, so IBD can upload raw content, and the system instantly categorizes, tags, summarizes, and prepares everything for campaign use.
The website promotes this idea through a clean, marketing-focused layout. The homepage introduces the problem in IBD's workflow and clearly present our approach to this matter. Subpages offer additional detail about how it works, features, and team information. It uses gradients, card layouts, and visual expandable placeholders, that make the concept feel modern and user centered. It mantains a cohesive bran identity through all the website, and reinforces the value and innovation of this project.
